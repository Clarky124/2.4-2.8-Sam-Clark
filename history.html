    <h1 class="title">The History of AI</h1>
    <p class="description">The idea of Artificial Intelligence has been around since the late 1930s with the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Ever since the launch of Siri in 2011, AI has taken off and has taken many forms since then. Before 2011, AI was mostly only seen in science fiction films.</p>

        <h1>Real Life</h1>
        <p>The first real form of AI was made in 1951 and was an artificial intelligence that played chess. The actual term of 'Artificial Intelligence' was invented in 1956 at a conference on the idea of artificial intelligence. As computers started getting smarter over the years, so did AI. By the 80s, most people were now aware of AI, and fears began to arise over it becoming too smart. In the late 2000s and 2010s, AI really took off, after the release of Siri in 2011, it seemed like every big tech company has started making their own kind of AI to compete. Today AI serves a massive role in all of our lives. </p>

        <h1>Films</h1>
        <p>One of the first signs of AI in a film was in the 1939 film, 'Wizard of Oz' which featured a tin man who was a human at once but was turned into a robot without a heart. After WW2, interest sparked up in technology, which helped with the birth of the 'Sci-Fi' film genre. The first big budget Sci-Fi film was made in 1956 and was called 'Forbidden Planet', which featured a AI robot called 'Robbie the Robot' who was a house servant which did the human's bidding. In the 80s people became fearful of AI which is portrayed in movies like 'Terminator' which shows AI being weaponised for evil. From the 2000s and onward, we see AI in film being portrayed as something useful in everyday life, but also as something that we should be careful of.</p>

    <h1 class = "singularity">The Singularity</h1>
    <p class = "explain">The singularity is the term for the point in time when artificial intelligence becomes smarter than the smartest human alive. Once this point has been reached, it is believed that artificial intelligence will become smarter and smarter even faster than ever before and will most likley overthrow the humans. The singularity is shown in the Terminator films, where the AI becomes too smart and launches the USA's nukes and takes over the world. The singularity is something many people fear, and the scary thing is, we are aproaching that point very quickly, with it predicted to happen in about the year 2040.</p>
