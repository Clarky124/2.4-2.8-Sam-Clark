        <h1>Devices</h1>
        <p>Siri started off in 2011 on the iPhone 4S as a flagship feature of the new phone. Since then, Siri has made it's way onto pretty much every other Apple device, such as the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Airpods, and the Apple Homepod. On more newer devices like the new Apple Watch, Siri can detect falls or irregular heart beats and contact emergency services which is amazing as it can literally save a life.</p>
