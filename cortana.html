        <h1>Devices</h1>
        <p>Cortana started off in 2014 on Windows 10 computers and the now obsolete Windows phone. Since then, Cortana has made itself available on the Xbox One (Then removed in 2019), Apple and Android devices as an app, and some third party smart home systems. Over the last 18 months, Microsoft has changed their focus on Cortana to be a downloadable software on all devices instead of a software soley on Microsoft devices.</p>
